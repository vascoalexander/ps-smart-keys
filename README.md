# PS Smart Keys

A small Hotkey Script to toggle Tools and Modifies in Photoshop

**Toggle Tool Function**


The Script uses one Hotkey that toggles between two Tools with the hotkey pressed or released state. (default: F2)
You can select which Tools to toggle with 2 Dropdownboxes. The Primary Tool is active in the released state while the secondary chosen Tool is active when you hold down the Toggle Button - release the Button to switch automatically back to your primary Tool.

The Hotkey is inactive when:

- only one Tool is selected
- no Tool is selected
- primary and secondary Tool are the same

**Note**: When you select Tools while no Photoshop Window is detected the script is closed


**Hot Modifier Function (global)**

Activate the Checkboxes to constantly hold down a modifier Key (Alt, Ctrl, Shift).



**IMPORTANT**: The Script uses the Standard Shortcuts for the Tools. If you have changed this shortcuts the script may not work as intended.

You need to have [Autohotkey](Link: http://www.autohotkey.com/) installed to make use of this script. (or use the compiled executable Version)

Use the Script at your own risk...
